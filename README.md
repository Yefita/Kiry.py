## Kiry.py

Kiry.py is a scraper for indonesian-translated-eastern-style-comics pirate site: Kiryuu, written in python.

### Instalation & Usage

I write this for use on termux and not anything else. in theory it should work in anything that run lastest python3. but, its not tested.


To install this script just clone the repo and edit config.ini(or not).

    git clone https://github.com/Yefita/Kiry.py.git

To run it: cd to Kiry.py directory then run Kiry.py. also make sure that you have all dependency installed on your devices.

    cd Kiry.py &&
    python3 Kiry.py
    
This script is so simple it doesn't have argument or anything fancy like that.

### Why?

I write this script to learn about python and web scraping, and just think i'll start from something simple. also yes this is my 1st python script, don't be too harsh to me.

### Others

  - if you encounter an error: well.. good luck!
  - if the website change: thats the day this script die, I wont update this script.
  - if you're the owner of Kiryuu: ma'ap bang. E-mail: zueyenfe@gmail.com or Discord: yellowfin_tuna (will take it down if you ask so)
